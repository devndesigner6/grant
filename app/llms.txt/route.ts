## Details

A personal context file is one structured profile that describes who you are and how you want AI to respond. Creed organizes it into ten sections: Identity, Goals, Work, Preferences, and Routines as the always-on core, plus optional Beliefs, Constraints, People, Health, and Context.

Agents connect over MCP (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, ChatGPT) and read the file before answering, then propose narrowly scoped updates that you approve. The file is plain Markdown you own: bring your own AI key, keep your tokens, and export or delete everything at any time. There is no lock-in.

Creed works for one person or a whole team. The Company plan adds one shared Company Creed that every member's agents read, with member roles, an activity view across the team, and admin controls.
